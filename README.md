## Introduction:

This project is a simple, static web page intended to demonstrate some basic competency with HTML and CSS. It was originally supposed to a personal portfolio but I decided to make it a little goofy, as you'll soon find out!

## Conclusions:

Prior to this project, I had a *basic* understanding of HTML---I really only had experience doing backend stuff, so this was all very new to me! It quickly became eye-opening, however, as the degree to which you can design a website purely using HTML and CSS was far greater than I had previously thought. 
There was definitely a bit of a learning curve, specifically with some of the finer points of the CSS. Tweaking all the properties became a matter of trial and error while I was trying to figure out how I wanted everything to look, but the bulk of the work, which utilizes the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, was accomplished without much trouble. So, I wanted to challenge myself a bit and add some *cool* animations to transition into each section. They're admittedly a little gaudy and obnoxious but I had a fun time learning how to get them to work. Overall, I'm very pleased with the outcome and I'm excited to see the functionality I can achieve in the future when I start incorporating JavaScript.
